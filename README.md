## 🚀 How to Use
1. Click "Train AI" to teach the robot
2. Click buttons to move the robot
3. Watch the green path to see where robot wants to go

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 Interactive maze game with obstacles & rewards
- 🤖 AI learns using Q-learning algorithm
- 📊 Real-time training visualization
- 🎯 Multiple game modes
- 📱 Web-based - no installation needed

## 🧠 How AI Learns
1. **Exploration**: Tries random moves initially
2. **Learning**: Updates Q-values based on rewards
3. **Optimization**: Finds shortest path to goal
4. **Mastery**: Consistently wins the game
